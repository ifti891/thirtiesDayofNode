## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Nodejs, JavaScript

Just took a single concept everyday, because i love Nodejs. 

## Optimizations

As i was occupied with many other projects i can only practice and work with barebone Nodejs and javascript. 

## Lessons Learned:

It's one of those experiences when you try to take a bath in a cold shower. It's the those few seconds fear, and afterwards you actully enjoy that cold shower. That's how Nodejs is.
